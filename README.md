## ‚ú® Feature highlights

| Area | What Optimum does |
|------|------------------|
| **Motion-based detection** | Scans the last 48 h of **CMMotionActivity** and treats any merged stationary stretch ‚â• **5 hours** (‚â§ 15 min gaps) as a sleep segment. |
| **HealthKit optional** | *Reads* **Step Count** to refine quality scoring and (if you allow) *writes* detected **Sleep Analysis** blocks. |
| **Daily dashboard** | ‚Ä¢ *Hours Slept* & *Bedtime* for ‚Äúyesterday‚Äù<br>‚Ä¢ Sleep-quality stars (1‚Äì5, remembered across relaunches)<br>‚Ä¢ Tap-through detail screens. |
| **7-day trends** | Swift Charts for Bedtimes, Hours, Quality, and Steps ‚Äì bars/points automatically adopt your accent colour. |
| **Quality algorithm** | Rule-based (duration vs goal, fragmentation, bedtime regularity, activity). User edits override the algorithm. |
| **Personalised cues** | **Local notifications** for caffeine cut-off (-6 h) & wind-down/melatonin (-1 h) relative to your target bedtime. |
| **Accent theme** | One-tap colour picker; charts, stars, and UI accents recolour instantly. |
